//In some dice games like Craps, a roll of two 1's is called "Snake Eyes".  It's generally not a good roll.  Please write a function called isSnakeEyes, which accepts two numbers as inputs, representing two dice.  If the two numbers are both 1's, please print "Snake Eyes!" otherwise print "Not Snake Eyes!"

output: 
isSnakeEyes(1,1) //Snake Eyes!
isSnakeEyes(1,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
isSnakeEyes(4,5) //Not Snake Eyes!
//


function isSnakeEyes(die1, die2){
    if(die1===1&& die2===1){
    console.log('Snake Eyes!');
    
    }else {
        console.log('Not Snake Eyes!');
}
    }
